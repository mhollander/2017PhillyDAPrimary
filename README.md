# 2017PhillyDAPrimary
A way to explore the May 2017 primary election for district attorney.  Presents an interactive choropleth map of the strength of a candidates support in each division and ward in Philly.  The darker the precinct, the higher the support.

## Election Results
Resulsts were published here and downloaded into this project: http://phillyelectionresults.com/

## Map
The ward/division shapefile came from the open data philly website: https://www.opendataphilly.org/dataset/political-ward-divisions

## Where can I see this?

## Other
Created for no other reason than to learn more about leaflet, shiny, election resulsts, etc...  I'm open to someone coming up with other ways to explore this data.  I'd also like to do this in a way that isn't dependent on the particluar office; in other words, it would be great if this were to read the vote file in and make the same map for all of the different offices, not just DA.  But I haven't thought about how to abstract his in that way, yet.
